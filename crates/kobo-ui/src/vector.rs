//! Resolution-independent icon drawing.
//!
//! # Why this replaces a bitmap grid
//!
//! Icons used to be sixteen-by-sixteen bitmaps scaled by whole cells. Whole
//! cells because a resampled bitmap blurs, and blur is the one thing a panel
//! with sixteen grey levels cannot render convincingly. That was the right
//! trade for a first version and it produced exactly what you would expect: at
//! three pixels per cell a book is a fat rounded blob and a diagonal is a
//! staircase. Photographs of the panel showed it plainly.
//!
//! The scale is the problem, not the artwork. A 300 pixel-per-inch panel draws
//! a 48 pixel icon; the source had sixteen. So the source is now geometry, in a
//! 1000 by 1000 box, rasterised at whatever size the layout asks for.
//!
//! # Why coverage, when thin antialiased strokes are supposed to ghost
//!
//! Because the alternative is worse, and the panel already does this for text.
//! The renderer picks its waveform from the pixels themselves, so an icon with
//! grey edges is driven by the same sixteen-level update that draws the
//! sentence beside it. What ghosts on E Ink is a *two-level* waveform crushing
//! antialiased edges, that is a waveform choice, not an antialiasing one.
//!
//! # Why applications cannot supply paths
//!
//! Nothing here is reachable over the protocol. An application names a
//! [`Glyph`] and the runtime draws it. Arbitrary path data from
//! an application is an untrusted input to a scanline rasteriser and a way for
//! one application to draw something indistinguishable from a system control.
//! A curated set is the same choice the rest of this UI layer makes everywhere.
